Domain
	example.com

Subdomain
	this.example.com
	that.example.com

	Ok, technically com is a domain and example.com is a subdomain.



Domain vs Zone
	A DNS server is authoritative (responsible) for a zone.
	This could be an entire domain but typically (?) is only part of a domain (one or more subdomains?).
	Zone: a domain minus any subdomains that are delegated to other DNS servers.
	This is described with a single SOA (start of authority) record, which must contain an NS record.



NS Record
	Name Server

	"An NS record lists authoritative name servers for a zone".
	A single domain can be delegated to several name server:
		google.com	=> ns4.google.com
		google.com	=> ns3.google.com
		google.com	=> ns2.google.com
		google.com	=> ns1.google.com

SRV record
	SeRVice record
	Specification of data in the Domain Name System lookup

		https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782

_service._proto.name. TTL class type priority weight port target.
	service		e.g. SIP, LDAP, etc
	proto		TCP or UDP
	name		domain name for this record (has trailing dot)
	TTL			Time To Live
	class		always IN (internet)
	type		always SRV
	priority	lowest is most preferred
	weight		for records of same priority; higher is preferred
	port		port on target host of this service (SIP is 5060, SIP over TLS is 5061, etc)
	target		domain name of target host (has trailing dot)
					must be one or more address records
					must not be an alias

We are typically interested in the target - we can do an DNS lookup on the target and it should return an address (A or AAAA) record with an IP address.

$ dig _sip._udp.redas.iop1.broadworks.net SRV
$ host -t SRV _sip._udp.redas.iop1.broadworks.net
$ nslookup -querytype=srv _sip._udp.redas.iop1.broadworks.net
$ nslookup
> set querytype=srv
> _sip._udp.redas.iop1.broadworks.net
_sip._udp.redas.iop1.broadworks.net. 4 IN SRV	2 50 5060 as2.iop1.broadworks.net.
	service		_sip
	proto		udp

	class		IN
	type		SRV
	priority	2
	weight		50

Address record
	Maps hostname to IP address

	A			32-bit IPv4 address
	AAAA		128-bit IPv4 address

	Address record
